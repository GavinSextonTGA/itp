# Band Assignment
(Our Website)(https://royzilber.github.io)

One of the most helpful resources for us was the sample project on the github repository, we decided altering the both the html and css from there would be far more convinient and efficient than starting with a clean slate. We struggled with fonts and some syntax but overall it went very smoothly. The website actually turned out far better than I thought it would. The block quote was borrowed from (cssfontstack.com)(https://www.cssfontstack.com/Orbitron) ( we never got the font to work sadly)

# Personal Contribution
I was sort of the leader when it came to the ideas and deligation of tasks and I helped Roy figure out some of the implimentation and I was mostly responsible for the css file. 
## Will
Will was responsible for a majority of writing on the site as well as the music on the site. 
## Roy
Roy was the main programmer as he typed in the code and was also responsible for the image on the site.
