# Bim Dating Simulator 
My project is a fully functioning dating simulator made in Renpy with a character in a Gamemaker game that a peer and I have been working on. 

## Resources
Renpy's website will be crucial as they explain in great detail how to navigate the engine

W3 Schools has a comprehensive tutorial on python in general that is easy to reference to and I forsee me checking frequently

Honestly while its not exactly a great source I will probably watch a few youtube tutorials on Renpy because its easier to digest

## Plan
The Bim dating simulator will star hit character Bim, where Bim is unaware of the fact that the player wants to date him and is eternally oblivious to their approaches. It will feature dialogue decisions that lead to a bunch of paths that all end up with Bim being blissfully unaware of the relationship but instead various comedic things take place. Renpy is so generous as to already come with a majority of the underlying template for a dating simulator as to allow more time for writing and art. If I'm feeling ambitious I might try to add more robust features but this is the base plan
## GOOD
A functioning Dating simulator that does not crash and delivers an entertaining Linear story
## BETTER 
A functioning Dating Simulator that has multiple endings and portrays Bim as to how he is in the Game that I'm making on the side
## BEST 
A robust Dating Simulator with either a gift system or a card game system as I'm fascinated that that has been done in Renpy before and I love card games
