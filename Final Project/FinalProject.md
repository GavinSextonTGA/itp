# BIM SIM
## I'm doing this later because of how much I procrastinated with this project 
Ok so Bim is a character for my game that me and a friend are working on. The game that I'm working on is a roguelike co-op platform fighter, though its on a hiatus at the moment. My friend did the majority of the code for the game and I was in charge of art, story, and game design though we are both addicts of game design. 
One of the goals of the project was to test out writing for Bim but honestly after completing it I know less about him than I did originally.
The idea of the main protagonist being in an eternal hell forced to interact with Bim is really funny to me and if anything I think the humor shines. 
### Reflection First 
Honestly I'm not happy with this project, I worked on stuff in the wrong order leading to no time to work on the writing or any of the cool features I wanted. 
If I were to do it again I'd love to tackle a card simulator as honestly the coding aspect of this project was light and boring, but highly informative. I probably wouldn't be able to do this vision before but now I feel confident I could.
### Week 1 
Downloading Renpy was really annoying for some reason. Everytime I tried to get it to act as an application it would stop to be able to load, so currently the only version of renpy I can open has a date at the end of it and can only be accessed in finder. 

#### Coding in Renpy
It took a while to even get the show function to work correctly but it turns out that actually naming the file I want it to access stops it from working with the normal show function, if I wanted to name the file I would have to define it with the image function. I decided to just do the show function as it was cool and new. 

I jumped in way too deep immediately, I wanted text sounds to work and I found a video for it but my understanding of how renpy works was really limited, I didn't even realize I had to initialize python in order to get most non-built in code to work.

I believe by the end of week one I finally got the image of bim to load correctly 

### Week 2 
I got some placeholder assets that I thought would be temperary, they were downloaded on itch and they are by Potat0master. [They Can be Found here ](https://potat0master.itch.io/free-visual-novel-backgrounds-school-mini-pack-1)

The music that I intended to be placeholder as a JOKE is this remix of A Girl Next Door on GameChops. Its by Sprightly and can be found [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=uMCUI7gk__Q&t=0s)

This, as well as resizing Bim was what I did in this week. Though luckily I think by technical issues subsided, except for indentation that still took a bit. 


### Week 3, Post thanksgiving
PROCRASTINATION
Legit I think I got some facial expressions working and thats it. 

### Week 4 
MORE PROCRASTINATION
I created the variable system and I made new outfits for Bim.
### Saturday Before Due
I get all of the images I wanted working in the correct folder and resized correctly
### Sunday Before Due
Slept all day, completed the first screen entirely during my comitment I had. 
### DAY BEFORE DUE 
LEGITIMATELY EVERYTHING ELSE!
All writing and ending Ideas

All menus past the first 2 

Debugging!

### Day its Due
This doccumentation file.

## Reflection But again
Honestly looking at other people's projects I'm even more upset with mine. I think this is the first time I did something to be funny but I should have done something else. I guarentee a card sim would have been better but I was intimidated by Renpy being built for visual novels. 
November/December was a REALLY ROUGH time for me. I slept through half my classes and stopped taking care of myself. Depite me hating on my project I'm still happy I got something done and I understand a lot about my workflow and what I should do. As I type this I have a music project I have to do entirely today... this is NOT happening next semester I swear!


I really wanna make that card sim though...
